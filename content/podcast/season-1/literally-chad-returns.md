In this week's episode, I share with you part one of a two hour conversation that I had with Everyone's Favorite Chad, the one that's Literally Catholic: [@Literally_Chad](https://www.x.com/literally_chad).

This episode, like I said, is part one. I felt like a big two hour thing was a bit too long, since my episodes average about 70 minutes. I didn't want to suddenly double the runtime for you guys. Unfortunately part two of the audio was lost to time.

I would love to give you notes on what we talk about, but we really run the gamut and talk about everything. This discussion started out as us taking on getting guys to just DM the girl and get married so we can have more Christian babies, but we ended up - pretty immediately - moving on to other topics.
