Pr. Hans Fiene of Bread Twitter was kind enough to sit down for an hour and speak with me about being a pastor, his Lutheran Satire side-project on YouTube, and our general attitudes about the world around us. 

I had a great time speaking with Pr. Fiene, and I really enjoyed his perspective on things. What's so amazing to me, especially going back and listening over the editing process, was how thorough, intelligent, and quick he was with all of his answers.

I do not send questions ahead of time, and all his answers were natural, off the cuff answers. 

Truly one of the kindest, most intelligent men I've ever met. I'm honored to have him on.
