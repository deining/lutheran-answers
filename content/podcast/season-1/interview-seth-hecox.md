I had the overwhelming joy of getting to sit down and speak with Rev. Seth Hecox, an ELCA pastor and member of the band Becoming the Archetype. Rev. Hecox tweeted a question: Would you be willing to admit Jesus was wrong?

It got him in some trouble with conservative Christians of various stripes. I figured I would take the time to have him on and let him, in his own words, explain the point he was trying to make. 

We also spent quite a good amount of time speaking about ministry, our denominational differences, and his band, Becoming the Archetype - one of my all time favorite musical acts.

I hope you enjoy this episode!
