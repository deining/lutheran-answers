I had the lovely opportunity to sit down with Dr. Stephen Parrish and discuss his book [Atheism?: A Critical Analysis](https://amzn.to/45lOpjL) as well as general philosophy and theology within a Christian World View.

I had such a wonderful time doing this and I cannot wait to sit down again with Dr. Parrish some time. I hope you enjoy listening to this episode as much as I enjoyed recording it.
