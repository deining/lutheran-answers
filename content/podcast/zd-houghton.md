In this episode of Lutheran Answers, I had the pleasure of sitting down and having a very thoughtful and encouraging conversation with Mr. Zack Houghton. Zack, who goes by [@ZDHoughton](https://www.twitter.com/zdhouton) on Twitter, graduated from a Reformed Baptist Seminary with a Master's Degree in Pastoral Leadership and was a Baptist minister for some time before being convinced of the Lutheran Confessions.

Today you can hear us discuss Baptist theology, Mr. Houghton's personal journey, and the comfort that the confessional Lutheran view of Christian theology truly brings.

And, keep your ear open to the beginning! You'll hear pretty early on (about the 7 minute mark) a cut in the audio. That's because a storm blew over my town briefly and knocked my power out! I was actually off the call immediately after asking Zack a question.
