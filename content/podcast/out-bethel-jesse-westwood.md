In this episode I am joined by Jesse Westwood, who spent several years at the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry (BSSM). Jesse recounts his time there, the kinds of things he saw, and the odd practices that people engaged in, and what brought him out of it all. We discuss the comforts of confessional Lutheranism and our shared perspective of what it is like to leave Charismatic American Christianity and go towards a classic and historic approach to Christianity.
