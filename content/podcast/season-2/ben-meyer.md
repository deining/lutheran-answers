On this episode of Lutheran Answers I got the chance to speak down with my dear friend Pastor Ben Meyer.

Pr. Meyer is such a wonderful man, and such a great pastor. He does so much for the online Lutheran Community, and it was so great to sit and chat with him.

Unfortunately for Pastor Meyer, only a fool would be on this podcast.
