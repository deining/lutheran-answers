This week I sit down with Twitter's very own C. D. Henry to discuss his journey to Lutheranism and the comforts of Lutheran Theology. 

We also spend an inordinate amount of time discussing alcohol preferences.

It was truly a great time, and even cutting out about 20 minutes of personal chatter, we're still at the 80 minute mark, making this one of the longer episodes I've recorded.

I hope you enjoy!
