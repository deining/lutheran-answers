On this episode of Lutheran Answers I sit down with Jared to discuss American Evangelicalism, Dispensationalist Eschatology, and play a fun little game where we try to figure out if we're reading a line from a Contemporary Christian Music Worship song or the 50 Shades of Gray series.

It was a lot of fun!
