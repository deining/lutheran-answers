My very dear friend Madelyn Rose Craig was kind enough to come on my podcast and discussion creationism, language, and her work on her book Names, Nations, & The New Testament. 

Maddy and I spent a very long time talking through a ton of different issues, some briefly (Nephilim), some very in depth (the impartation of language to humanity), and it was such a lovely time.

I've had her amazing husband Josh on twice now and I'm ashamed it took me this long to have Madelyn on.

I hope you enjoy this episode!
