Literally the most relaxed interview I've ever had.

I had the absolute pleasure of sitting down with Pr. Ricky Beckett and recording probably the most chill interview in the world. We just kinda... talk. We cover everything from politics, to video games, to Lord of the Rings... It's great!

I hope you enjoy listening to this as much as I enjoyed recording it!
