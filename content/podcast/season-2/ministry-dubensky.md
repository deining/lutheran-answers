On this episode of Lutheran Answers, I sit down with Pastor Matthew Dubensky, graduate of Concordia St. Louis, and pastor to the saints St Paul Lutheran Church in Chicago Heights. 

We discussed what ministry is like coming out of the seminary, differences between denominations, pastoral education, preaching, teaching, and so much more! I hope you enjoy this episode.
