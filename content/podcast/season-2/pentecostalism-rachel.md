I got to sit down with my very dear and completely engaged friend Rachel Gernhardt to discuss what it was like to grow up in a Pentecostal tradition.

I hope you enjoy this episode! As you'll hear it was recorded 3 or 4 months ago during Advent! But don't worry, I've spent all this time recording and meeting people and lining up interviews for a great year!

What a kick off for Season 2 of the Lutheran Answers Podcast!
