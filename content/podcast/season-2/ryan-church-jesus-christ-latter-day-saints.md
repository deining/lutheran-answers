I had the wonderful joy to sit down with very excellent Twitter Lutheran Ryan Moody to discuss his journey from Baptist, to Atheist, to Mormon, to Lutheran!

We spend some time discussing what Mormon culture is like, how he became a Mormon, and what ultimately lead him to the comforts of Confessional Lutheranism.
