In this fresh tasty episode I spent an hour speaking with Roman Catholic [@Literally_Chad](https://www.twitter.com/literally_chad) about Tim Sledge's ([@Goodbye_Jesus](https://www.twitter.com/goodbye_jesus)) book "[Four Disturbing Questions with One Simple Answer](https://amzn.to/3xmCemf)" - a book that supposedly no Christian can get through without doubting their faith.

Unsurprisingly we both made it through. 

I hope you enjoy this episode!
